    │   └── env.js           # Environment validation
    └── package.json
```

## Running the Application

1. Navigate to the T3 app directory:
   ```bash
   cd ai-chatbot-t3-app
   ```

2. Ensure your `.env` file has the OpenRouter API key:
   ```
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-actual-api-key"
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open http://localhost:3000 (or http://localhost:3001 if port 3000 is in use)

## Features Ready for Use

- **Chat with AI**: Select a model and start chatting immediately
- **Model Selection**: Choose from free models (Llama, Gemma, Mistral) or premium models (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
- **Real-time Responses**: See typing indicators while AI is processing
- **Error Handling**: Proper error messages for API issues

## Next Steps for Full Feature Parity

While the core chat functionality is working, the following features from the original app still need implementation:

1. **File Upload Processing**
   - Implement file upload API routes
   - Add file processing services (PDF, images, documents)
   - Integrate with chat context

2. **MCP Plugin System**
   - Set up MCP server management
   - Implement plugin communication
   - Add Perplexity, Brave Search, and Firecrawl integrations

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Voice input/output
   - BMI and CGA calculators
   - Session management
   - Chat export/import

4. **Production Readiness**
   - Add authentication (if needed)
   - Set up database for chat history
   - Configure deployment settings
   - Add monitoring and analytics

## Benefits of T3 Stack Migration

1. **Type Safety**: Full end-to-end type safety with tRPC
2. **Modern Architecture**: Latest Next.js features with App Router
3. **Better DX**: Improved developer experience with hot reload and type checking
4. **Performance**: Optimized builds and server-side rendering
5. **Scalability**: Ready for deployment on Vercel, Netlify, or any Node.js host

## Conclusion

The migration provides a solid foundation with working AI chat functionality. The application is now built on modern, production-ready technologies while maintaining the core features users expect.
